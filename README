Common Lisp Thrift Bindings

Author: Patrick Collison <patrick@collison.ie>

- Depends on ACL for reading/writing floats
- Requires ASDF with usocket and trivial-utf-8

Sample usage:

(defclass calculator-client (thrift::client) ())

(let ((calc (thrift:binary-client 'calculator-client "127.0.0.1" 9090)))
  (print `(1 + 1 is ,(add calc 1 2))))

(defmethod add ((h calculator-client) num1 num2)
  (format t "~&Asked to add ~A and ~A" num1 num2)
  (+ num1 num2))

(let ((srv (thrift:simple-server "127.0.0.1" 9090)))
  (thrift:serve srv 'calculator-client))
